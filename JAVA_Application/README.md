Register the JDBC driver which requires to initialize a driver so we can open a communication channel with the database.
```
```bash
STEP 3: 
Open a connection using the DriverManager.getConnection() method to create a Connection object, which represents a physical connection with the database.
```
```bash
STEP 4: 
Execute a query by creating an object of type Statement for building and submitting an SQL statement to the database.
```
```bash
STEP 5: 
Extract data from result set: Requires that you use the appropriate ResultSet.getXXX() method to retrieve the data from the result set.
```
```bash
